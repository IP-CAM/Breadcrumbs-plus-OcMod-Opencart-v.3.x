# Breadcrumbs+

## Description
The Breadcrumbs+ extension is for CMS Opencart 3.x. It allows to manage breadcrumb navigation path of products. Also, the extension allows to add JSON-LD structured data markup for product breadcrumb navigation to categorize the information from the page in search results, allows to remove links from the last breadcrumb items and make them font to bold.
